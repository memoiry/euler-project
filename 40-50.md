It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32
27 = 19 + 2×22
33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

```
isSquare[x_] := IntegerQ[x/2] && IntegerQ[Sqrt[x/2]]
isnotConjecture[x_] := 
 If[Select[
    Table[isSquare[x - Prime[i]], {i, 1, 
      NestWhile[1 + # &, 1, Prime[#] <= x &] - 1}], # == 
      True &] == {}, x, 0]
Select[isnotConjecture /@ Table[i, {i, 3, 6000, 2}], # != 0 &]//First
```

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers?

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

```
Select[Flatten[
   Table[Sum[Prime[i], {i, k, j}], {k, 2, 
     NestWhile[# + 1 &, 1, Sum[Prime[k], {k, 1, #}] < 1000000 &] - 
      1}, {j, k + 1, 
     NestWhile[# + 1 &, 1, Sum[Prime[k], {k, 1, #}] < 1000000 &] - 
      1}]], PrimeQ] // Max
